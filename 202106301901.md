move fast <> think clear

there isn't one size fits all answer to understand this statement. IMHO, **move fast** somehow does collide with **think clear**. but the point I select out from this is do while you're thinking. A simultaneous process. 

It's the same with agile-ish (I guess). do, test, modify, and do it again. spending too much time fine tuning something may prevents us from doing what we should have done earlier. Maybe being proactive it's all about doing a bit with up-front work to predict (or, prefectch) the potential scenarios and better prepare the plan B if thing goes south. 
We know better, then we do better. 

Once you know what to do, you know what the priorities are.
