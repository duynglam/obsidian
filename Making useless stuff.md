title: Why I prefer making useless stuff

PoV
- out of passion
- practice based on interest
- nno expectation or obligation to ever become more. It is just for fun, learning, and curiousity.
- be the programmer and the user -> knows what the messgae/ context means
- there's no 'deadline'
- no harassment / judgement 
- thee satisfaction from having people actually use the code would greatly outweigh the inconvenience of being pestered about new features.



Fix your own pain point -> that how you prove your product works
- because it works for you
solve it once for yourself
then reuse it, end up saving for everybody
