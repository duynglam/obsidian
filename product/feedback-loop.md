### What is feedback-loop
- the process of witnessing users using your product
- see how they response
- collect their reaction
- put in measure
- generate the pros and cins
- pivot to improve

->  Feedback Loop happens by collecting user's opinion on your product. Then use it to grow your product better.


### How is helps driven business growth
- first, it shows that you care about your user
- it has objective opinions. which is real, and rare
- it validates the product idea
	- does your product fits the market
	- your product level comparing to the opponents
	- it portraits user's behaviour

-> then you build the next version, focus on those metrics.


### Create feedback loop
Feedback loop can be created through 3 purposes
1. gather data
- select relevant channels where user interact
- customer interviews
- email follow ups
- surveys

2. analyze data
- setup tracking metrics 
- select core metrics 
- analyze data
-> how to improve those metrics

3. make data useful
- adjust the product if the feedback <> the product goal
- inform users about the change
- thank them for contribution -> close the loop

#### Personal Input
Hubspot and Treveloka are the two best example for CS and feedback loop I suppose. 
they're in quickly response and follow up when the service awaiting time is extended.
user knows exactyly where to drop a feedback or asking FAQs.
