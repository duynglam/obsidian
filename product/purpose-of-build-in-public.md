- [Building in Public: How Tech Companies Master Product-Market Fit (entrepreneur.com)](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/359180)

### Ideas
- Consumers know that companies wants to turn a profit
- But consumers tend to engage with businesses that put the consumer before profits.
- #buildinpublic allow consumers to witness how their product was crafted, based on the needs and consumer feedbacks

### The purpose
A problem with tradition launching - where makers publish their product once it's ***done & ready***, is they might talke a while for user to get familiar, finding the mutual rhythm, acknowledge the useful points and start adopting the product.

Meanwhile, build in public enables testing for beta users. By bringing thing in public, makers get to receive the feedback and adjust accordingly. People love to hear stories, and be a part of the story. 

By the time the product is ready, makers get two things:
- A finetune, market-fit product
- A community who loves and expect to put the product in real use
- Builds trust through transparency process
- Allows users to test and offer advice > conduct market research
- Build audience before official launch
- Optimize product-market fit
