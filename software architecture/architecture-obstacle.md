**Abstracts**
It's getting harder to choose the right architecture for our software

**Note**
- philosophy get changed: iterative development
- focus more on incremental changes >< overal design/architecture
-> dev measure challenge = technical debt, rather than software architecture. 

- developer focuses on releasing new features
- meet demand of feature request > deploy code > technical debt gets increases
-> fix technical debt to make sure features works
-> architecture gets messy
