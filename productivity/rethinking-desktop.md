title: Why Desktop Needs Rethinking
---

Computers have been treated like a virtual office
- you come to work
- type in your memos and business documents
- save them in documenth shelves (in this context, folders on desktop)
- its the end of the day. you shut the laptop. leave the 'office', and go home

The problem
- No internet: it's hard to search the file (because it's hard to remember the location of file/folder)
- With internet resolve
	- turn hard documents (files) into fragments (online files)
	- we use open tabs as the sort of memory > then download them onto local folders
	- but still, can't manage to remember the stuffs
	- The problems
		- temporary opened tabs
		- junkie files over the desktops & bookmarked links
		-  ideas and informational fragments, but either donâ€™t live on the disk as files in the traditional sense, or live solely within cloud services accessed through a browser, or are so hard to recover

- Appreciation 
	- for search engine (for online stuffs)
	- for spotlight (locals documents)
> Desktop should be simple and transparent, like internet-based.


The resolution for modern users
- Desktop interface should be customized for findable fragments (through metadata)
- Usage of each fragment should be tracked (open, access, review, copy) - not jsut 'last modified', but how it was modified
- Close stuffs after users dont use it. (cut off the review) -> it hurts the system memory/ performance. Don't delete it, file it with metadata -> easier to find
- Customized on 'should-be-delete' fragments: web history, or clipboard documents, download files that have never been accessed. 
- Build bulk delete
