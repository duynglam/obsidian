difference between html 4 va 5
- html 5 uses semantic element
- html 4 uses class & IDs -> indescriptive

why html5 is better
- create meaningful tag to better describe what the elements are about
- correct element <> correct purpose
- avoid confusion (misunderstand <div> and <span>)
- easy to maintain
- support SEO (search engine can read the properties based on tags)
