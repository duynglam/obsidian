**V-model**
stands for verification model/ validation model

**Keyword for Getting Started**
- Waterfall Model: A sequential model divided into different phases of SDLC. Each stage is designed to perform a specific activity. Testing phase starts only after implementation (the last stage) of the system is done.
- V-Model: A process where testing is done on each phase, happens parallel to development steps. 


**Problem with Waterfall Model**
- testing starts after Implementation
- easy to miss out the key details in the requirements 
- takes longer to detect error -> higher cost
-  products get shipped out wrong
- start all over again

**Why V-Model is the Solution for Waterfall Model**
- each development step comes with a corresponding test phase
- ensures the process move toward the same goal: build error-free product


**Scenarios for to apply**
- Waterfall Model:
	- short term project
	- requirement are not changing frequently
	- resources are stable and available
- V-Model
