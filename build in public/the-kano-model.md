title: the Kano Model
---

### definition
- a model to define the essential level of the next features
- based on Kano model, product's features are created out of 3 level
	- Threshold Attributes: the basic functions. users expect this
	- Performance Attributes: unnecessary, but it increase user's retention.
	- Excitement Attributes: additional function, make the product different.


### example & execution
**example** of 3 level in a cellphone camera function

|attributes|description|example|purpose|
|---|---|---|---|
|threshold|basic functions|back camera|enter the market|
|performance|update UX|front camera| maintain the market|
|excitement|delight users|QR code scan| exceed as pioneer|

the Kano model then applies these 3 types into 2 metrics: 
- Customer Delight: how it increase customer's UX
- Implementation Investment: the cost to build & maintain features

**execution**
- brainstorming all possible features
- catergorize them into 3 levels
- make sure you keep the basic functions
- remove irrelevant/ indifferent/ duplicate features
- consider turning *performance* features to *excitement*
- evaluate implementing cost
- assess user segment <> cost they can afford
- map them into product roadmap 

### use cases to apply
goal: prioritize which feature to work on next
 limited time
 limited resources
 marketing testing
 minimum feature

-> my best guess is startup/ MVP
