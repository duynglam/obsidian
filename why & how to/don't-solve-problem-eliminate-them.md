title: Don't solve problem. Eliminate them
---

Solving problem may be a good solution for current issues.

But solution comes with maintenance.

First try to eliminate the problem if possible, rather than seeking solution. 

In fact. don't seek problems until you actually grab a context and experience dealing with us.
