tl;dr
- work hard can only happen when you've defined the goal
- there are 3 ingres to great work: natural ability, practice and effort. pretty well takes 2; the best takes 3. 
- cultivate a sensitivity to what you do, you'll notices when the result starts to drop. it's critical in oth directions: either you're being lazy, or you're working too hard. 
- understand the shape of real work, then arrange your capability
